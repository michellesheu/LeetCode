class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
# First, we need some function or array that represents the answer to the problem from a given state. For many solutions on LeetCode, you will see this function/array named "dp". For this problem, let's say that we have an array dp. As just stated, this array needs to represent the answer to the problem for a given state, so let's say that dp[i] represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends with the i 
# th
#   element. The "state" is one-dimensional since it can be represented with only one variable - the index i.

# Second, we need a way to transition between states, such as dp[5] and dp[7]. This is called a recurrence relation and can sometimes be tricky to figure out. Let's say we know dp[0], dp[1], and dp[2]. How can we find dp[3] given this information? Well, since dp[2] represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends with nums[2], if nums[3] > nums[2], then we can simply take the subsequence ending at i = 2 and append nums[3] to it, increasing the length by 1. The same can be said for nums[0] and nums[1] if nums[3] is larger. Of course, we should try to maximize dp[3], so we need to check all 3. Formally, the recurrence relation is: dp[i] = max(dp[j] + 1) for all j where nums[j] < nums[i] and j < i.
# The third component is the simplest: we need a base case. For this problem, we can initialize every element of dp to 1, since every element on its own is technically an increasing subsequence.
        dp = [1] * len(nums)
        # dp[i] represetns the length of LIS that ends with the element at index i
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            for j in range(i):
                if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        return max(dp)
